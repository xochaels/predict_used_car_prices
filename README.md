# Predict Used Car Prices

Hello, I have created a project on predicting the prices of used cars. I obtained the data from a learning module on the 365 Carrear website on Udemy. The method I used is regression, and there are various algorithms that can be used to achieve success in this project, including LinearRegression, Ridge, KNeighborsRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, and RandomForestRegressor.


The structure I used for this project and for future projects is CRISP-DM, which includes the following stages:
1.	Business Understanding
2.	Data Understanding (including EDA)
3.	Data Preparation (including data cleaning, feature engineering, and future scaling)
4.	Data Modelling (including feature selection, selecting model technique, building model, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV)
5.	Evaluation (including finding the best model and future importance)


Through Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, I found that the GradientBoostingRegressor algorithm was the best performing, with a score of 0.91. If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section. Thank you.
